<p>The information in this section is a set of notes about issues of
concern to HIRES users.
The topics included below are:</p>
<ul>
<li> How to assess the resolution of a HIRES.</li>
<li> The effect of image dynamic range</li>
<li> HIRES photometry and flux stability with integration</li>
<li> HIRES positional accuracy</li>
<li> Dealing with saturated data</li>
<li> Making ratio maps from HIRES images</li>

<h2>Achieved Resolution </h2>
<p>The resolution in a HIRES image not only varies from band to band but also
from point to point within a single map. The variation from band to band is due
mostly to the inherent point spread differences between IRAS bands. The
variation within a map is due primarily to coverage variations from
point-to-point and secondarily to signal-to-noise variation from
source-to-source.  The rate at which a source approaches the limiting resolution
depends, in part,  upon the source strength relative to the background.  In
a map containing both strong and weak sources, the weak sources will appear
noticeably broader than the strong sources. </p>

<p>The beam sample maps, which are among  the standard <a
href="images.html">hires image types</a>, are particularly valuable in
estimating the achieved resolution for a given source at a given point in the
map. You can specify both source fluxes and positions  for the beam sample maps.
Fluxes and positions from the PSC2 or FSC are adequate for this purpose.</p>

<p>To get an idea of the typical performance of HIRES, the following table (W.
Rice, 1993,<i>AJ</i>,<b>105</b>,69) gives the mean beam width of 13 stars.  The
quoted number is the full-width half-maximum cited as (cross-scan x in-scan) in
arcseconds. </p>

<h2>Dynamic Range</h2>
<p>The dynamic range of HIRES is limited on small spatial scales (on the order
of 10') to about 1:100. You should be careful in interpreting faint structure
near bright sources.  At small spatial scales it is best to work at intensities
within 5% of the peak value.</p>
<br />

<h2>Photometry</h2>
<p>An important thing to consider about HIRES images is the flux calibration.
In general, fluxes measured from the intensity maps agree with those of the
Point Source Catalog (PSC2) to within 20%.</p>
<p>Background estimation when doing aperture photometry with HIRES
can be tricky, particularly when ringing is present. </p>
<p>In addition you must consider the impact of the AC/DC effect (see material on
<a href="iras_data.html">iras data</a>); for extended sources you may
want to apply a source size dependent flux correction.</p>
<br />

<h2>Flux Stability</h2>
<p>It has been found that fluxes measured from HIRES images vary by up to 20%
over the course of iteration. <em>Flux is not conserved until most of the
resolvable structure has been resolved</em>. The following numbers relating
iteration number and flux have been found (G. Laughlin, D. Engler and W. Rice,
1990, IPAC IOM 701-90-077):</p>

<br />
<p>NOTE: All HIRES images are made using the Level 1
Archive CRDD, which has the most recent calibration ("Pass 3").</p>
<br />

<h2>Positional Accuracy</h2>
<p>Testing with HIRES to determine the positional accuracy of point sources was
carried out. It was found that the HIRES centroid positions are within 20" of
the PSC2 positions on average and the peak positions are within 30". Since the
HIRES processing makes much more complete use of the position information than
the PSC processing did, the HIRES positions may be the more accurate ones, but
no studies to show this have been done to date. </p>
<br />

<h2>Saturation</h2>
<p>The detectors saturated at about 1000 Jy. Saturation can be diagnosed
in the cfv maps (see HIRES <a href="images.html">output image types</a>), which
show high variances on source that do not decrease with further iteration. In
theory, HIRES may be able to reconstruct saturated sources by excluding data
from the detectors which passed directly over the saturated source, using only
those detectors that passed near the saturated source. HIRES would,
essentially, reconstruct the peak from the wings of the point source. </p>
<br />

<h2>Ratio Maps</h2>
<p>Many users would like to make high resolution color or ratio maps from HIRES
maps.  Be warned though, the resolution in an image not only varies from band to
band but also from point to point within a single map.</p>
