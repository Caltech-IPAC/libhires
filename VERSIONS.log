-------------------------
v1_10:
-------------------------
 - Added MIN_SAMPLE_FLUX parameter to force sample flux values to be
   at least the specified value. (defaults to leaving all fluxes as is.)

-------------------------
v1_09:
-------------------------
 - Updated calculation of angle to be correct even at end ponts of scans.

-------------------------
v1_08:
-------------------------
 - Restructured code, converting the Sample and Footprint data into Numpy arrays.
   (to speed up processing)
 - Removed "noise" from Sample and "weight" from Footprint
  (to speed up processing --- was not being used)
 - Removed "pad and trim" logic (for footprints partially outside image area)
   (to simplify code --- user may specify larger image size if desired)
 - made a vectorized version of the Gnomonic function
 - changed Gnomonic to use -x, +y to correspond to signs of the CDELTS
 *** The interface from IN data file readers has been modified.

-------------------------
v1_07:
-------------------------
 - Reversed order of array indexes to j,i (was i,j).
   This means that the -y,-x in call to Sample should be reversed too in reader of IN files
 - Added a DRF_ID keyword to FITS headers.
 - (Temporarily added a kludge to internally simulate a 2D Gaussian from a 1D one,
    but no longer there since the DRF generator was upgraded to do 2D gaussians.)

-------------------------
v1_06:
-------------------------
 - added FLUX_MIN minimum flux in input data samples (reset flux value if less)
   -- default is -1.0e200  (leaves flux as is)
     (this option is to avoid crossing zero in flux image)
 - added log method (for output messages and log file)
   -- added lots of checks for WARNINGs and ERRORs
 - organized parameter printout and added comments to make more understandable

-------------------------
v1_05:
-------------------------
 - added logic to use Sample.angle
 - added logic to weight samples (1/noise_squared)

-------------------------
v1_04:
-------------------------
 - added (optional) output of cfv files ("correction factor variance")
    (like YORIC "cfv" files)
 - updated logic to use padded images during computations, trimmed before output
    (better quality near edges of image)
    and option to output "padded" image that can be used as "STARTING_IMAGE"

-------------------------
v1_03:
-------------------------
 - the normal starting (ITER=0) image is now 'flat' (all pixels = 1.0)
 - optional generation of BEAM ouptut files (BEAM_SPIKE_N  BEAM_SPIKE_HEIGHT)
      (like yoric 'bem' files)
 - new parameter to select which output file types are generated (OUTFILE_TYPES)
     choose any/all of: flux cov beam (default is flux only)

-------------------------
v1_02:
-------------------------
 (delivered to IRSA)
 BASIC CAPABILITY:
  - creates high resoltion flux files
  - uses DRF files for computing "footprints"
  - creates cov file (coverage image)
  - adds full set of FITS keywords to images
 OPTIONS:
  - number of iterations to do (ITER_MAX)
  - which iterations to output files (ITER_LIST)
  - specify outuput image size (NPIX)
  - specify outuput image scale (ARCSEC_PER_PIX)
  - give a STARTING_IMAGE
  - specify footprint sub-pixel accuracy (FOOTPRINTS_PER_PIX)
  - specify added FITS keywords such as CTYPE, CRVAL
  - compute tangent plane ("gnomonic" -TAN) projection x,y coordinates
  - amplify amount of correction per iteration (BOOST_CORRECTION)
