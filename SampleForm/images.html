<h2>Surface Brightness Image</h2>
<img src="images/img.gif">
<p><b>img_m51_b3_20<br />surface brightness image, 60 &#181;m, 20
iterations</b></p>
</div>
<p>This image represents the actual IRAS infrared sky as processed by the MCM
algorithm. Intensity is in units of mega-Janskys per steradian.</p>

<div align="center">
<h2>Coverage Image</h2>
<img src="images/cvg.gif">
<p><b>cvg_m51_b3<br />coverage image, 60 &#181;m</b></p>
</div>
<p>The coverage image gives the sum of the weighted detector response at each image
pixel over all detector samples. The actual number of detectors contributing to
a particular pixel is roughly twice the value of that pixel in the coverage image.
Examination of the coverage image can indicate non-uniformities in detector
coverage.</p>

<div align="center">
<h2>Correction Factor Variance Image</h2>
<img src="images/cfv.gif">
<p><b>cfv_m51_b3_20<br />correction factor variance image,
60 &#181;m, 20 iterations</b></p>
</div>
<p>The correction factor variance image gives the statistical variance about the
mean correction factor (computed for each detector) for that pixel.</p>

<p>The MCM algorithm iteratively approximates the real sky by correcting the
intensity in each pixel so that the simulated scan data are maximally similar to
the actual scan data. If all the detectors agreed exactly on what the flux of a
given pixel should be, all the correction factors would be one and the
correction factor variance at that pixel would be zero.</p>

<p>For a typical default-processed source with good signal to noise, the
correction factor variances at iteration 20 should be between 0.001 and 0.01.
Areas with relatively large correction factor variance either indicates the
presence of data which do not agree with the majority of the scans (a "bad"
scan, for example, or 3rd HCON calibration differences) or noisy or saturated
regions.  Alternatively, the source may not yet be as resolved as is possible
with the MCM. A high correction factor variance <b>may</b> indicate the field
would benefit from further iteration.</p>

<h2>Photometric Noise Image</h2>
<img src="images/phn.gif">
<p><b>phn_m51_b3_20<br />photometric noise image, 60 &#181;m, 20
iterations</b></p>
</div>
<p>The photometric noise image indicates the internal photometric error of the
detector samples resulting from the averaging of those that overlap, and is
essentially the standard deviation of contributions to each pixel. It does not
include absolute errors such as calibration errors. These image can thus be used
to show the relative noise across an image, but not the absolute level of the
photometric noise.</p>

<h2>Beam Sample Image</h2>

<h2>Spike Plus Background Model Input Images</h2>

</div>
<p>The beam sample image are a fairly sophisticated tool for estimating the
achieved resolution in the HIRES images. The beam sample images make use of the
simulation capability of HIRES, which allows
the generation of modeled detector scans for an arbitrary input image. </p>

<p>For the beam sample images, the input image is a pattern of spikes of
user-specified integrated flux density planted on top of either a smoothed
version of the 20-iteration HIRES image of the input field or a flat background.
By default, either 25 spikes in a 5 by 5 grid (1 degree square field) or 81
spikes in a 9 by 9 grid (2 degree square field) with a height of 10 Jy are used.
You may specify the positions and/or height of the spikes and doing so will
provide optimal results. An option to plant spikes where a point source filter
detects point-like structure is also available. One spike plus background model
image is generated per band.</p>

<p>Once the spike plus background model input image has been generated, simulated
unenhanced scan data for it are generated. These data are then passed through
HIRES as if they were real IRAS scans, and the resulting images are output, once
for each surface brightness image, as the beam sample images.  A two-dimensional
gaussian fit is made to each spike location and the results reported in the beam
width report.  The resolution of the spikes at a given iteration should be a
good indication of the resolution of a real point source of that flux at that
location in the HIRES image. However, there are many reasons why some variation
might occur and the beam sample images should be interpreted carefully.</p>

<h2>Detector Track Image</h2>
<img src="images/det.gif">
<p><b>det_m51_b3<br />detector track image, 60 &#181;m</b></p>
</div>
<p>This is a image which indicates which detector's center hit each pixel. If the
center of a detector "footprint" (two dimensional modeled response function) hit
a pixel, its ID is recorded in that pixel. If more than one detector hits a
given pixel, the last to cross is kept. If no detector center hit the pixel, the
value zero is kept.</p>
