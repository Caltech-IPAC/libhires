<h2>Point Spread Function (PSF) </h2>

<p>Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) point sources do not appear circular,
primarily because the detector apertures were rectangular. In fact, the PSF of
an IRAS source is determined both  by the detector mask shape  and the geometry
of the scans covering the source. Thus, in a raw IRAS image point sources appear
elongated, with the narrow dimension in the scan direction and the larger
dimension determined by the cross-scan width of the detector. Click <a
href="images/fp.gif">here</a> for an illustration of the focal plane indicating
the detector sizes.  Near the ecliptic poles, the PSF may even be X-shaped!
This is because the survey strategy allowed nearly orthogonal scan directions
near the poles.</p>

<p>For unenhanced coadded images
the resolution is approximately 1' by 5', 1' by 5', 2' by 5' and 4' by 5'  at
12, 25, 60 and 100 &#181;m, respectively.  For "medium resolution" images (e.g.,
the IRAS Sky Survey Atlas (ISSA) all four bands are
smoothed to the 100 &#181;m resolution. For HIRES
images, the resolution varies in a complicated way.</p>

<br />

<h2> The AC/DC Effect </h2>

<p>The IRAS detectors had a dwell-time dependent responsivity change. Hence, the
gain changes as a function of source size: at the IRAS survey speed of 3.85
arcminute/s,
the gains leveled off for structure on the order of 30' in extent.  This effect
was band-dependent and largest at 12 &#181;m. Thus, there are two calibrations
for the IRAS data, the calibration appropriate for point sources, known as the
AC calibration, and the calibration appropriate to very extended structure,
known as the DC calibration. To bring point source fluxes measured from
DC-calibrated products to the AC (same as the Point Source Catalog V2.0 [PSC2])
calibration, the fluxes must be divided by 0.78, 0.82, 0.92 and 1.0 at 12, 25,
60 and 100 &#181;m, respectively.</p>

<p>All non-point-source-filtered IRAS image products produced before April 1993
were DC calibrated. This includes early HIRES and FRESCO images and ISSA. After
April 1993, FRESCO and HIRES images were switched to the AC calibration. Point
source fluxes obtained by aperture photometry with appropriate background
subtraction on AC calibrated images should be consistent with the PSC2. It
should be noted that neither calibration is strictly correct for structure on
spatial scales intermediate between
point sources and 30'.  Intermediate-scale corrections must be derived from
inspection of the plots in the

<h2>Stripes </h2>

</div>

<p>Stripes are streaks in the scan direction (i.e., orthogonal to the wide
dimension of the PSF) that are brighter or fainter than the background in the
adjacent scans. They are the result of detector response variations and real
background/foreground variations from scan-to-scan during the survey.</p>

<p>Much effort has gone into developing methods to minimize the effect of
scan-to-scan variations.  These techniques are collectively known as
de-striping. Comparing the original Sky Brightness Maps (SKYFLUX, also sometimes
called the HCON Images because a separate set was created for each
hours-confirming coverage) with the new
 <a href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/IRASdocs/issa.html">ISSA</a> images
provides a dramatic demonstration of the efficacy of de-striping! Nevertheless,
IRAS images often retain striping at some low level.  HIRES may tend to amplify
any low-level striping present, particularly in relatively featureless
fields.</p>

<br />

<h2>Flux-dependent Responsivity Changes</h2>
<p>The survey array detectors exhibited non-linear responsivity variations with
the total flux falling on the detector. This effect can be quite large at 60 and
100 &#181;m, but is not well characterized.</p>

<p>Because the zodiacal background observed by IRAS varied substantially during
the survey, this means there are calibration differences between different
observations
of the same source at different times. This can be particularly obvious when
HCON 3 images are compared to or combined with HCON 1 and HCON 2.</p>

<br />

<h2>Optical Crosstalk</h2>

<table cellpadding="5" border="0">
<tr>
  <td align="center"><img src="images/crosstalk.gif"></td>

</tr>
</table>
</div>



<p>Very bright (&gt 500 Jy) pointlike sources may have a characteristic
six-pointed star shape. This is due to reflection from the telescope secondary
mirror struts.  Approximately 5% of the peak flux may be contained in the star
pattern. There is no known method for removing this effect.  Resolution
enhancement, e.g. with HIRES, may enhance or break
up the crosstalk pattern if it is present.</p>

<br />

<h2>Saturation</h2>
<p>The survey detectors tended to saturate for sources brighter than 1000
Jy.</p>

<br />

<h2>Hysteresis Effect: Shadowing</h2>

<p>Shadows or trails are produced in the scan directions at 60 and 100 &#181;m,
particularly upon crossing the galactic plane, especially near the galactic
center. The most recent (Pass 3) calibration alleviated this effect to some
extent.</p>
<br />
<h2>Hysteresis Effect: Point Source Tails</h2>
<div align="center">
<table cellpadding="5" border="0" width="400">
<tr>
  <td align="right" valign="top"><img src="images/ps_tails1.gif"></td>
  <td align="left" valign="top"><img src="images/ps_tails2.gif"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="2"><b>Two images showing 12-&#181;m point source tails.  To the

with both ascending and descending scans. Each image is about
30' across.</b></td>

</div>


<p>Bright point sources may appear to be smeared out in the scan direction(s).
This can happen in any band, but is most dramatic at 12 and 25 &#181;m. In
extreme cases the point source "tail" may extend for a degree or more. If the
source was scanned both descending and rising, it will have tails in both
directions, and the tails may resemble stripes; tails can be distinguished from
stripes because they diminish with distance from the bright source. This effect
is not well enough modeled to be removed from the data.</p>

<br />

<h2>Glitches/Bad Data</h2>
<p>Radiation hits on detectors occasionally remain in the data and appear as
very transitory spikes. Occasionally a bit of debris may have lit up the entire
focal plane
simultaneously, causing a non-physical regular pattern in the images.</p>
