<p>HIRES can produce good results for relatively weak sources. However, the
achieved resolution does depend upon source strength, coverage and background
complexity. Following are some rules of thumb for choosing good HIRES targets.

<hr>
<h2>The source should be "sufficiently bright"</h2>

<p>Unresolved sources should be brighter than about 1 Jy. Extended sources
should have emission greater than about 2 MJy/steradian. Also, the local
signal-to-noise ratio should be fairly high (~10 or greater) in order to avoid
possible complications in baseline subtraction and to help ensure the
achievement of high spatial resolution in the region of interest.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is also the case that HIRES can sometimes help in the
detection of faint sources by pulling them out of the cirrus background. HIRES
can sometimes reveal sources that are in neither the Point Source Catalog (PSC)
or the Faint Source Catalog (FSC). </p>

<b><p>Below 1 Jy, the results depend strongly on the background complexity.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tr>
<td><img align=top src="images/faint1.gif"></td>
<td colspan="2"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
<b>The illustration left is a 60 &#181;m image of a distant galaxy which was
absent from the IRAS catalogs due to background confusion with galactic cirrus.
The image is a 1 deg. by 1 deg., 1st iteration HIRES and the
point-like source in the center of the frame is the galaxy, at about 2
Jy.</b></font></td>

<table width="100%" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">

<tr>
<td colspan="2"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
<b>To the right is the 20th iteration HIRES image. This is an example of a
circumstance in which HIRES increased the contrast between the target and the
background sufficiently to allow it to be identified as a real
source.</b></font></td>

<h2>. . . but not <i>too</i> bright</h2>
<p>Very bright sources (&gt 1000  Jy) may suffer from
<a href="iras_data_features.html"> IRAS data features</a>
such as hysteresis, saturation and optical crosstalk.</b></p>


<br />
<h2>The target should have good detector coverage.</h2>

<p>HIRES will work over most of the sky; however, its achieved resolution is
quite variable depending, among other things, on the amount of information
(coverage) available.  It is desirable to have both a moderately large number of
scans and as much variation as possible in scan angle.</p>

<p>The number of scans available depends in part upon the number of
hours-confirming coverages (HCONs) the source received. Most of the sky has
three HCONs of survey coverage. Since IRAS was in a near-polar orbit, the
coverage also varies with latitude. Higher ecliptic latitude regions are also
more likely to have a variation in scan direction.</p>

<p>A good target should be covered by two HCONs of survey data or by at least
one Additional Observation (AO). The number of HCONs of coverage at or near a
given point can be found in the PSC, all of whose sources have at least two
HCON s.</p>

<p>In general, more coverage is better, but eventually calibration uncertainties
dominate.  There are a few sources which have more coverage than is needed.
More information can be gained about the coverage of a given nearly point-like
target by processing it with <a href="scanpi_over.html">SCANPI</a>. SCANPI is
the one-dimensional coadder; it also produces detector scan track plots within a
4' window of the input position.</p>
